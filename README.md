Currently we have a player, albeit a simple square, that can hit the floor, move side to side & jump.

Made a game engine that takes control of the frequency of rendering frames and also give us the abilty to pause / restart the game. Pause function needs to be re-thought as the 'p' key has to be released before the game pauses!!!
